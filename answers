This document outlines the steps taken to set up a development environment for software engineering projects. The chosen operating system is Windows 10, the primary text editor is Visual Studio Code, and the project will utilize Python.

# Tools Installed:

- Windows 10 (pre-existing)
- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Git (https://www.git-scm.com/) - version control system
- Python 3 (from https://www.python.org/)
- pip (package manager included with Python)
- MySQL (database - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Steps:

1. Installed Windows 10

- Downloaded Windows 10 ISO from the official Microsoft website.
- Created a bootable USB drive using tools like Rufus.
- Installed Windows 10 by booting from the USB drive and following the installation wizard.

2. Installed a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
   IDE Selected: Visual Studio Code

Steps:

- Downloaded Visual Studio Code from Visual Studio Code website.
- Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
- Opened Visual Studio Code and customize settings as needed.

3. Set Up Version Control System

- Version Control System: Git
- Repository Hosting: GitHub

Steps:

- Downloadeded Git from Git-scm.com.
- Installed Git by running the downloaded installer and following the prompts.
- Configured Git with my user information:

- Opened Git Bash and ran the following commands:
  i) git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ii) git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
- Created a GitHub account at GitHub Signup.
- Initialized a Git repository for my project:

- mkdir myfirstproject
- cd myfirstproject
- git init

Created a README file and make your first commit:

- echo "# My Project" > README.md
- git add README.md
- git commit -m "Initial commit"

Pushed the repository to GitHub:

- git remote add origin https://github.com/bryan-giitwa/myfirstproject.git
- git push -u origin main

4. Installed Python Programming Language and its Runtimes
   Programming Language: Python

Steps:

- Download Python from python.org.
- Ran the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is selected.
- Verify installation by running: - python --version

5. Installed Package Managers

- Package Manager: pip (included with Python)
  Steps:
- Ensure pip is installed:
  pip --version

6. Configured a Database (MySQL)
   Database: MySQL

Steps:

- Downloaded MySQL installer from MySQL Downloads.
- Ran the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
- Configured MySQL by setting up a root password and default schema.

7. Explore Extensions and Plugins
   Installed several extensions for Visual Studio Code to enhance functionality:

- Python extension for syntax highlighting and code completion.
- Pylint extension for static code analysis.
- GitLens extension for improved Git integration within VS Code.

Steps:

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon in the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
- Searched for and installed the desired extensions.

# Reflection on Challenges:

MySQL configuration: Setting up and configuring MySQL can be complex for beginners. It's recommended to refer to detailed tutorials for this step.

# Troubleshooting:

During Python installation, make sure to add Python to the system path during the installation process. This allows you to run Python commands from any directory in the command prompt.
